to make ssh-add read passphrase from a file?]]

#+begin_src shell
#!/bin/bash

if [ $# -ne 2 ] ; then
  echo "Usage: ssh-add-pass keyfile passfile"
  exit 1
fi

eval $(ssh-agent -s)
pass=$(cat $2)

expect << EOF
  spawn ssh-add $1
  expect "Enter passphrase"
  send "$pass\r"
  expect eof
EOF
#+end_src

If work with many other jobs, the =eval $(ssh-agent -s)= must be divided
into other part. 1. start the ssh-agent

#+begin_src shell
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
#+end_src

2. [@2] modify the ssh-add-pass script file

#+begin_src shell
#!/bin/sh

if [ $# -ne 2 ] ; then
  echo "Usage: ssh-add-pass keyfile passfile"
  exit 1
fi

pass=$(cat $2)

expect << EOF
  spawn ssh-add $1
  expect "Enter passphrase"
  send "$pass\r"
  expect eof
EOF
#+end_src

3. [@3] call the ssh-add-pass script file

#+begin_src shell
$ chmod +x ssh-add-pass
$ ./ssh-add-pass id_rsa passfile
#+end_src

the =id_rsa= file is the key private file, the passfile contains the
passphrase

4. [@4] on the same shell, to do more jobs. Like ssh connect to the
   remote server

#+begin_src shell
$ ssh user@192.168.1.1 -i id_rsa
$ scp -i id_rsa file user@192.168.1.1:/home/user
#+end_src

That is it.
