NOTE: This reply is a bit old. Since it talks about internals and unstable features, things have changed a little bit. The basic mechanism remains the same though, so the answer is still capable of explaining the undelying mechanisms of box.

What does box x usually uses to allocate and free memory?

The answer is the functions marked with lang items exchange_malloc for allocation and exchange_free for freeing. You can see the implementation of those in the default standard library at heap.rs#L112 and heap.rs#L125.

In the end the box x syntax depends on the following lang items:

owned_box on a Box struct to encapsulate the allocated pointer. This struct does not need a Drop implementation, it is implemented automatically by the compiler.
exchange_malloc to allocate the memory.
exchange_free to free the previously allocated memory.
