* lsp-bridge solidity usage

** clone ethereum contract repo

for example, use https://github.com/subquery/network-contracts

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/subquery/network-contracts
cd network-contracts
yarn install
yarn build
#+end_src

** emacs open StateChannel.sol

#+begin_src shell
emacs contracts/StateChannel.sol
#+end_src

** input a string, delete the string, and save the file

After this operation, the lsp-bridge can use _lsp-bridge-find-def_ command to view the definition of the solidity function.
