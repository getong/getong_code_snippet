Value:Size/TypeSpecifierList

The Size or the TypeSpecifier, or both, can be omitted. Thus, the following variants are allowed:

- Value
- Value:Size
- Value/TypeSpecifierList

The TypeSpecifierList is a list of type specifiers separated by hyphens.

##Type
The type can be integer, float, or binary.

##Signedness
The signedness specification can be either signed or unsigned. Notice that signedness only matters for matching.

##Endianness
The endianness specification can be either big, little, or native. Native-endian means that the endian is resolved at load time, to be either big-endian or little-endian, depending on what is "native" for the CPU that the Erlang machine is run on.

##Unit
The unit size is given as unit:IntegerLiteral. The allowed range is 1-256. It is multiplied by the Size specifier to give the effective size of the segment. Since Erlang R12B, the unit size specifies the alignment for binary segments without size.

Example:

X:4/little-signed-integer-unit:8

This element has a total size of 4*8 = 32 bits, and it contains a signed integer in little-endian order.

$erl
1><<3:4/little-signed-integer-unit:8>>.
<<3,0,0,0>>
2>

```
