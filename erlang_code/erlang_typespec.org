iolist()::maybe_improper_list(byte() | binary() | iolist(), binary() | [])
#+end_example

An iolist is a list containing binaries, characters, strings or other

** binary and bitsting
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: binary-and-bitsting

The difference between in a binary and a bitstring is that the length of
a binary is evenly divisible by 8, i.e.Â it contains no 'partial' bytes;
a bitstring has no such restriction.
