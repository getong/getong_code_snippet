** go vs push
#+begin_quote
Think of go as a way to jump to a new route. This will modify the underlying navigation stack
if the new route is not a sub-route of the old one.

On the other hand, push will always push the destination route on top of the existing navigation stack.

If you can, try to not use push and always prefer go instead,
since this doesn't require you to set special flags (such as optionURLReflectsImperativeAPIs),
and plays nice with deep links on mobile.
