# elixir func
通常，在单行代码使用do: 在多行代码使用do...end 语法
## do...end

```
%% times.exs
defmodule Times do
	def double(n) do
		n * 2
	end
end
```
## do:

```
defmodule Times do
	def double(n), do: n * 2
end
```


## inspect a list more then 50 elements

``` elixir
iex(1)> x = for i <- 1 .. 60, do: i
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42,
43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, ...]
iex(2)> inspect(x)
"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, ...]"
iex(3)> inspect(x, limit: :infinity)
"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]"
```
the list can be generated by Enum.to_list

``` elixir
x = Enum.to_list( 1 .. 5)
```

## try ... catch
BEAM distinguishes three types of runtime errors: errors, exits, and throws.

``` elixir
try do  
  ...
catch error_type, error_value -> 
  ...
end

```
