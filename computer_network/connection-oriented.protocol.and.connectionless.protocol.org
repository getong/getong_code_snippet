:END:
a connection-oriented protocol guaranties the delivery of the
information. An example of connection-oriented protocol is (TCP) and a
connectionless protocol is (UDP). TCP is a connection-oriented protocol,
it makes a connection and checks whether the data is received, and
resends if it is not. UDP is a connectionless protocol, it does not
guarantee delivery by first connecting and checking whether data is
received.
