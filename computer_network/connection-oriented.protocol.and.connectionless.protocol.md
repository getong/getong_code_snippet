# the difference between a connection-oriented protocol and a connectionless protocol
a connection-oriented protocol guaranties the delivery of the information.
An example of connection-oriented protocol is (TCP) and a connectionless protocol is (UDP).
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, it makes a connection and checks whether the data is received, and resends if it is not.
UDP is a connectionless protocol, it does not guarantee delivery by first connecting and checking whether data is received.
